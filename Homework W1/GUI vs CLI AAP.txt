I've gathered that there are several key differences between a GUI and CLI.
Almost everybody is familiar with GUIs.  Whether it is file explorer or
an in-application menu, we have used graphical user interfaces in our
file management and program navigation.  GUIs are designed with user-friendliness
and ease of access in mind.  They often have obvious graphical elements including
buttons and icons.

On the other hand, CLIs are useful to programmers and more tech-savvy users most
concerned with efficiency and direct access.  The most known example of a CLI is the
Command Prompt on Windows, which usually only serves to scare Windows users when it
opens, but it has many uses which are inaccessible via GUIs.  You can directly access
and interact with directories via CLIs and automate functions which would take
a long amount of time to accomplish with a GUI.

It is important to note that the command-line interface interacts directly with a
computer's operating system and expects/requires knowledge of the operating system's
tools.  As the name suggests, you can input commands which will always consistently
output a result or execute a task as instructed with no navigation or menu-searching
required.  This can also be the enemy of somebody who doesn't know what they are doing.
All in all, the power of the CLI is to provide a more thorough and efficient
tool to manipulate a computer's OS, while the GUI makes navigating the OS and its files
much easier and more comprehensive.
